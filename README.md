# Age--Calculator
This project is a Python GUI application developed using wxPython.
It allows the user to select their date of birth and calculate their age, along with some additional details related to birthdays and zodiac signs.
I created this project as part of my learning process in Python and GUI development, mainly to understand how date handling, buttons, events, and multiple windows work in wxPython.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The application takes the user’s date of birth using a calendar. Based on the selected date, it can calculate the current age, show the zodiac sign, display a countdown for the next birthday, show the birth flower and birth stone, and also calculate the age in any selected year.
Each feature is accessed using buttons, and most of the results are displayed in separate windows to keep the interface simple and clear.
